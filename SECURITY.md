# Security Improvements

## API Key Protection

The original implementation had a security vulnerability where the ElevenLabs API key was exposed in the client-side JavaScript code. Even though it was loaded from environment variables, the key would be accessible in the compiled JavaScript that gets sent to the browser, making it possible for anyone to extract and potentially misuse the API key.

### Changes Made

1. **Server-side API Proxy**:
   - Created server-side serverless functions that act as a proxy for the ElevenLabs API:
     - Netlify: `/netlify/functions/generate-voice.js`
     - Cloudflare: `/functions/generate-voice.js`
   - The API key is now only used on the server side and never exposed to client code.

2. **Client-side Code**:
   - Removed all references to the API key from client-side code in `App.tsx`.
   - Modified the `voiceController.ts` to make requests to our secure API proxy instead of directly to ElevenLabs.

3. **Request Flow**:
   - Client makes a request to `/api/generate-voice` (our own endpoint)
   - The request is redirected to the serverless function
   - The serverless function securely adds the API key and forwards the request to ElevenLabs
   - The response is passed back to the client

### Benefits

- The API key is never transmitted to the client-side code
- The API key cannot be extracted from your website's source code
- Server-side environment variables remain secure
- You retain full control of your ElevenLabs API usage

## How to Deploy

### Netlify Deployment

When deploying to Netlify:

1. Set the environment variable `VITE_ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` in your Netlify site's environment settings:
   - Go to Site settings > Environment variables
   - Add the variable with your ElevenLabs API key

### Cloudflare Pages Deployment

When deploying to Cloudflare Pages:

1. Set the environment variable `VITE_ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` in your Cloudflare Pages settings:
   - Go to your project in Cloudflare Pages
   - Navigate to Settings > Environment variables
   - Add the variable with your ElevenLabs API key
   - Make sure to set it for both Production and Preview environments

2. Enable Functions in your Cloudflare Pages project:
   - In your Cloudflare Pages project settings, confirm that Functions are enabled
   - The `/functions` directory will be automatically deployed as serverless functions

The difference is that in both platforms, the environment variable will now only be accessible to the server-side function, not to any client-side code.
