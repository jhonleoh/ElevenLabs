# Security Improvements

## API Key Protection

The original implementation had a security vulnerability where the ElevenLabs API key was exposed in the client-side JavaScript code. Even though it was loaded from environment variables, the key would be accessible in the compiled JavaScript that gets sent to the browser, making it possible for anyone to extract and potentially misuse the API key.

### Changes Made

1. **Server-side API Proxy**:
   - Created a server-side Netlify serverless function (`/netlify/functions/generate-voice.js`) that acts as a proxy for the ElevenLabs API.
   - The API key is now only used on the server side and never exposed to client code.

2. **Client-side Code**:
   - Removed all references to the API key from client-side code in `App.tsx`.
   - Modified the `voiceController.ts` to make requests to our secure API proxy instead of directly to ElevenLabs.

3. **Request Flow**:
   - Client makes a request to `/api/generate-voice` (our own endpoint)
   - The request is redirected (via Netlify redirects) to the serverless function
   - The serverless function securely adds the API key and forwards the request to ElevenLabs
   - The response is passed back to the client

### Benefits

- The API key is never transmitted to the client-side code
- The API key cannot be extracted from your website's source code
- Cloudflare environment variables are secure at the server level
- You retain full control of your ElevenLabs API usage

## How to Deploy

When deploying to Cloudflare (or any other platform), you still need to set the environment variable `VITE_ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` in your hosting provider's environment settings. The difference is that this variable will now only be accessible to the server-side function, not to any client-side code.
